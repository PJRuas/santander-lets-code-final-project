# santander-lets-code-final-project
E-commerce project for Santander Becas

Getting started:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose/Docker Desktop
2. Download source code
3. Go to project source /back-end and run the command: "docker compose up"

4. Available endpoints are:
  - 8080/product
  - 8080/review
  - 8081/order
  - 8082/user
  - 8082/user/{userId}/cart


5. Funcionality is as follows:
    a. POST a Product to 8080/product
    b. POST an User to 8082/user
      b.1. the application will generate a Cart for the user just created
    c. PUT a product in the cart 8082/userId/cart
    d. POST an Order to 8081/order
      d.1. the Order takes a Cart as input, placing an Order takes all items in cart and leaves it empty
      d.2. after placing an Order, Review service will be available for that purchase
    e. POST a Review to 8080/review
 Done! you can now perform GET requests to the same endpoints and see what you made!
